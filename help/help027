'IMMORTAL EXPERIENCE' 'DIVINE PRESENCE' 'DIVINE INFLUENCE'

Occassionally, the gods watch mortals. If they are pleased or amused by what 
they see, they often increase the mortal's experience as they grant favor. If 
they are displeased or disappointed in the actions of the mortal, they may sap 
experience to show their displeasure.

Note: Both reward and punishment should be kept in character. Generally the 
reward happens when an immortal noticed (though it might not be immediate) 
something that constitutes good roleplay. You do NOT need to pray a thank you 
and you should certainly not pray asking what it was for. The punishments 
usually happen when poor roleplay is shown, that is not severe enough for 
OOC punishment. Again, this should be kept in character and taken for what it 
is...a slight corrective hint to make sure you don't continue the behavior.

The following is guidelines as to what is promoted:

* For developing a backstory that considers the history of Haeckel
* For telling epic tales
* For writing books in-game
* For having impressive warcries: "I am His Anger and His Vengeance through which Darkness and Order reign!"
* For building and exacting plans with regards to factional play

Echo: You feel a divine presence guide you to new found experiences!
Echo: Divine influence saps some of your experience from you.
