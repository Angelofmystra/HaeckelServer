'EXPEDITIONS'

Basic Questions

*	How far is the target location?
*	Do you know any local guides? Is there a key benefit to asking a local guide?
*	Do we know of any threats enroute?
*	Do we know of any threats at the location?
*	Are there any weather considerations?
*	How could we carry the loot back?
*	How much supplies do we have and need?
*	Are there any local sources of food and water en route or at the location? Any known poisonous plants or tainted water?

Travel Logistics

*	I will assume at least one character is in armour. Thus 16 miles per day.
*	By Horse, that is roughly 32 miles per day.
*	If its trackless in forest, swamp, hills, then double the time. So 2 days by horse, 4 days by foot (in armour).
*	Trackless in plains? 1 and a half days by horse. 3 days by foot.
*	This creates easy numbers to plan for

Food & Water

*	Each day a character will need one trail rations. Since it takes day to reach the destination, and 1 day to return, that is a minimum of 2 rations. 
*	So we need to know how many days the party will spend at the adventure site

Example:

6am
	Players are at the settlement.
	For each day they spend there:
		- random encounters)
		- upkeep costs)
		- antagonist / competitor actions
		+ shopping
		+ recruiting henchment/followers
		+ investigation (gathering information, etc)

NB: Shopping in-game has the advantage that the players can investigate and then buy items appropriate to what they will face. The disadvantage is that there is a markup price to off-set this advantage.

Since 'gather information' skill takes 1d4+1 hours, the new time is (at minimum)

8am - 11am

Any further wasted time should be noted. Leave Time: This is the time the party leaves the settlement.

For simplicity, lets say Sun Set = 1830

Hours Till Nightfall = Nightfall Time - Leave Time

Party Traveling Speed = Speed of the slowest member

Distance Traveled = Hours Till Nightfall * Party Traveling Speed

In this basic scenario, this means there are 5 variations to the camping spot.

NB: Random encounters may force the spellcaster to use their spells. Remember Recent Casting Limits / Rest Interruptions, P.178 PHB

NB: Each interruption adds an hour to the time required for the caster to rest

NB: Spell Preparation Time: To prepare all spells, this can take an hour

NB: Preparation Environment: You cant prepare in swamps! They are neither peaceful, quiet, or comfortable to allow for proper concentration!

NB: Dark Cursed Forests prevent preparation unless you have a torch. You need sufficient light! If a forest is magically blanketed in darkness, then this is even harder!

Unhindered Travel Start Time = Sun Set + 0800 - 2400

Unhindered Start Time = 1830 + 0800 - 2400

Unhindered Start Time = 0230

Sun Rise = 0700
