'PRAYING'

*	Prayer Timeout
*	*	You may pray once per 4 hours of IRL Time. This usually means once per session.
*	A number of things will cause your pray attempt to automatically fail:
*	*	Your alignment record is negative
*	*	You are polymorphed into a demon or undead and are attempting to pray to a non-chaotic deity
*	*	Your deity is still angry at you from some other event, such as:
*	*	The land you are in is consecrated or desecrated
*	*	*	The dark underworld of Haeckel
*	* 	*	Temples of opposed alignment
*	*	*	Cursed forests
*	*	*	Areas of immense evil and tragedy, unless you worship an Evil sphere deity
*	*	*	Volcanos, unless you worship a Fire sphere deity
*	*	*	In the presence of those with an overwhelming aura of opposed alignment
*	Praying at an altar not of your deity will anger your deity (but will still work as normal)
*	Praying where there is no altar will succeed on a 1-2 on a d6
*	Praying at an altar will succeed on a 1-4 on a d6
*	Praying at an altar of an opposed alignment is an act of blasphemy and will make you a heretic of your existing deity
*	Dropping water on an altar and praying will turn it into holy or unholy water, depending on the altar's alignment
*	High Altars cannot be converted. They are directly protected by their respective Deity
*	To convert an Altar, you must either consecrate or desecrate it
