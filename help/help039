'GUILD VS CLASS'

Guild Pros

* Integration into society, more so than with classes, which contributes to immersion
* You are meant to ask for advise regarding your Guild from other Guild Members IC
* Defining it like this provides a way to integrate the physics of the world (mechanics) into immersion - especially in a Roleplay Enforced game where anything that cant be explained IC is banned

Guild Cons

* Not all players will want to be tied to a formal organisation
* There is a perceived standardisation, slightly more so than the Class, because usually you learn what the Guild offers

Class Pros

* Your class could represent an abstract concept or "gameplay" rather than an intangible real thing in the world

Class Cons

* There is a perceived standardisation
* You ask for advise OOC - breaks immersion - and ruins a potentially interesting part of the game

Notes

* I am looking at them two separately for the purposes of analysis. One could ofcourse blurr the definitions, or make it like a gradient of emphasis.
