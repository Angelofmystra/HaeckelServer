Quality of Life

* Making things easier to search/find. Example: 'Lesser cold orb' versus Lesser orb of cold. It is easier to find the later than the former because all the spells of similar power but differ in element type are next to each other.

* Making references to all relevant material

* Providing examples of concepts, in order to speed up improvisation, as well as clarifying game designer intent

* An appendix of sample characters for GMs
