'ROLEPLAY1'

In many cases you are presented with a situation where it seems like you must discuss OOC concepts IC - thus breaking immersion.

An example of this would be telling someone to check a specific helpfile on a topic such as LAWS.

In Haeckel RPG we aim to provide (either formally or informally) ways to address any issue like this in-character.

With the example mentioned above, here are some solutions you could use:

"Search your memories for LAWS"
"Meditate on LAWS"
"Search your Guild's libraries on the LAWS of Haeckel"
"Ask around the Tavern about the local LAWS, or perhaps ask the Militia"

You would put the word to be searched in caps so that characters would not need to 'guess the noun'.

This is a necessary sacrifice for usability sake.
