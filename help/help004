'ANTI PATTERNS'

Anti Patterns are essentially the opposite of what patterns represent. As with Patterns, there is disagreements on what is an anti-pattern. 

* Power without gameplay
* Burden of Knowledge
* Unclear Optimization
* Use Pattern Mis-match Surrounding Gameplay
* Fun Fails to Exceed Anti Fun
* Conflicted Purpose
* Anti-Combo
* False Choice - Deceptive Wrong Choice
* False Choice - Ineffective Choice
* Or we could **** the player
* Non-reliability without benefit
