'POV CHARACTER'

POV

* POV characters need a story, can be a very short story. A semblance of a beginning, middle, and end, even if its not connected to the main story.
* Resist POV characters who are there just to be a pair of eyes. Better to present it as a report that someone receives, or a rumour, rather than third guardsmen on the left. 
* Do you just need the story or is full dramatisation necessary?
* Centrally located POVs, deeply involved, breakthrough in POV choice that simply falls into place
