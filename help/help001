'DESCRIPTION' 'DESC'

Generally, your description should say what other see when they look at you, so:

* Size
* Stature
* Clothing
* Colour of your hair and eyes
* Distinguishing characteristics
* The way you move
* It may say something of your background if it is apparent from your appearance

It shouldn't convey information that cannot be determined without talking to you, or casting spells on you, such as:

* History
* Thoughts
* Alignment
* Motivations
* Beliefs
* Goals

However it may provide sensory clues to tip someone off to these, such as weathered skin, scarring around the wrists or neck, or an "outdoorsy" odour. Keep everything tangible.

Your description may include some small things you do when people look at you, such as a nod, smile, or blessing, but you cannot do things like killing someone, or summoning them, or anything like that. Remember that your character must do these things every single time someone looks at you, and many times you may not be aware of their gaze.

Your description is often one of the first things someone sees about you. Its primary purpose is to create a visual image that sets you apart from everyone else, and its secondary purpose is also a great way to start conversations.

If you include gear specifics in your description, make sure to keep it up-to-date with what you are actually wearing. I highly suggest putting it into a separate paragraph to make such editing easier.

And finally, minimise actions in your description. While it is perfectly acceptable to include a few mannerisms or habits, you should avoid doing anything interactive in your description, such as: "He stops to shake your hand". A good rule of thumb is to minimise the use of the words "you" and "your" in your description whenever possible.
