Personalities

A jester whose wagon is destroyed on the roadside. Due to his hysterical voice and constant dancing, he is considered eccentric by some and totally insane by many. The local peasant refuses to help him. He is carrying the corpse of his mother. 

A half elf roadside bandit. He seems to be preying upon travellers and building a small hideout in the dense grove of trees. He is extremely chilled out and relaxed.

A one-armed road traveller who speaks with a dwarven accent (despite his obvious human heritage). 

A hideous man with blackened skin. He looks like a alchemist fire victim. The lower half of his head is covered in a bandana and he wears black goggles that are tinted such that you cannot see his eyes. His bandana moves as he speaks, he talks with a coarse and muffled voice.
