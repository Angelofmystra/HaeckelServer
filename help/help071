This character speaks, thinks, and acts like a lawyer. Other characters dislike his dryness, like a stone battered by the seas. He says such phrases as:
* including, but not limited to
* merisms
* "The defendant is prohibited from communicating with the plaintiff, either personally or through other persons, by telephone, writing, or any other means." The second half like a challenge: 'try finding a loop hole' he implies, 'my word is Law.'
