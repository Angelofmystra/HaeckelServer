'UBRIS FUROR GENRE'

This list, while indicative of the genre, is by no means compulsory. These are not laws. They are not rules. They are more like strong guidelines.

It is intended to use the independent cities system as a modular way for the various authors to have their own ideas. 

1. Anti-authoritarian Main Character (MC)
2. Most everything is corrupt
3. Humans vs Demi-Humans (racial conflict/tension)
4. Third-world like wealth gap, wealth disparity
5. Corporate Extraterritoriality
6. Independent Cities allow for modularity in genre and theme
7. Noble Houses that operate essentially like Mercantile Houses. Some Old Guard claiming ancient descendent to places like - Pharaohs, Ancient Heroes (freedom fighters), and all kinds of stuff. A body of myth. Multiculturalism. Calls others hegemonic

Noir

Draws influence from german cinema. From Nietzche. From german expressionism as well as american noir. 

1. Ubersmenche - leading society. Adventurers. 
2. Noir Protagonist (Loner, Libertine, but keps it classy, cynical on the outside but principled on the inside, probably used to be a cop/authority until sacked for insubordination. Fedora tilted just so.)
