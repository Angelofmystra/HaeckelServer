'DREAD'

The key components of roleplay can be summarised to:

D = Description
R = Role
E = Emote
A = Action
D = Dialogue

Other considerations include:

* Race
* Class
* Culture
* Alignment
* Psyche
* Upbringing & Social Class

Role can be simply explained as this:

* What do you want to accomplish with this character?
* They involve universal themes such as love, hate, betrayal, victory, defeat, and more.
* Ideally, information in your role should encompass the Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How of your character.
* If you wish to go further, some successful role-writing styles that I have seen include narrative, short entries, and letters.
