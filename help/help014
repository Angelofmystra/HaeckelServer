'SCOUNDRELS'

* Scoundrels break rules
* Scoundrels think on their feet
* They avoid fair fights
* They know their enemies' weaknesses
* They dont restrict themselves
* They get dirty - They don’t sit back and let others do all their work . They’re willing to participate in every aspect of an operation or adventure.
* They apply themselves - Scoundrels are motivated by drives and desires . These might be specific ambitions, such as money, revenge, love, freedom, or fame, more general passions for action, thrills, adventure, and may- hem, or even mere curiosity.
* They rely on instincts. They act when they sense the time is right . This instinct might merely be luck, but it is often tempered by experience and an individual scoundrel’s sense of a person or situation. Scoundrels consider how others think, or at least guess how they would react in a situation, and from that often anticipate their opponents.
* Scoundrels are not all corrupt. Although many are less than moral paragons, scoundrels can use deception to right wrongs, trick the unjust, and do away with vil- lains . Even the least materialistic might rob from the rich and give to the poor, or perform similar daring acts of charity.

The words “scoundrel” and “rogue” have similar meanings, but one does not need to be a member of the rogue character class to be a scoundrel . While rogues often do adopt the lives of daring and cunning common to scoundrels, so can barbarians, bards, rangers, and sor- cerers . In fact, nothing prevents members of any class from taking up lives ruled by their own wit and resourcefulness .

Roguish types are not meant to be as powerful as the other classes. They dont rely on brute strength, raw power, or magical might. That is their game. Not your game. You cant win by playing their way. A roguish type is about playing your way. And that way is not fair.
