'ROLEPLAY2'

Roleplay Enforced / Roleplay Mandatory

* Roleplaying in-character is compulsory
* Requires the development of in-game social protocol to handle any event that would seem difficult to handle IC
* Requires a standards system, and almost like a set of rules regarding the characters. like Quality Assurance.
* Almost guarantees an internally consistent world - assuming Roleplay Enforced is implemented correctly
* Requires player involvement in the enforcement and promotion of roleplay since true RE/RM is impossible to 100% guarantee.

Roleplay Promoted

* Relies on the "carrot on a stick" approach to player motivation
* Means that the standards of roleplay are much lower than in roleplay enforced, though the upper end may see no difference. Certainly the average level of roleplay is reduced.
* 

Roleplay Optional

Note: There are some characteristics that are not mutually exclusive, and some that are exclusive. 

TMS lists the RP options as "None", "Accepted", "Encouraged" and "Mandatory", while TMC lists them as "Non-Roleplaying", "Accepted", "Encouraged" and "Enforced". As a result, I've always assumed that "RP Enforced" and "RP Mandatory" were intended to be equivalent to each other.
