'VAGHUUL'

Vaghuul, the Cleaver of all that draws breath.

Cleric Devotee of the Kraken, Crusader of the Water Domain

========================================
DESCRIPTION
========================================

Entrance Desc: He lumbers slobberingly into sight, wielding a great vicious two sided axe, a terrible mask of pure iron formed in the shape of some tentacled monster, and donned in a bluish black plate mail that is covered in rust.

A man with a long grey beard with seaweed intertwined between it, and various kinds of moss and lichen covering his navy-blue-dyed rusted plate mail. His bony hands grip tightly a vicious two bladed great axe, one blade is shimmering blue, the other a slimy green. The hilt is formed from blackened charred bone. On his finger is a ring made of pure coral, it has ominous scarring with bits of chipped teeth trapped in its engravings. His facial skin is extremely dry, and seems to be peeling. His eyes are a chillingly cold grey with a slight blue pigmentation. His nose is long and pronounced, like a hawk.

========================================
ROLE
========================================

* He seeks to build great monuments in worship of the Kraken. 

* He intends to make sure his civilisation is the greatest power in the world so that the Kraken will slake its initial hunger on them first, thus sparing them from the Eternal Madness to follow. 

* He aims to enjoy his life the Old Way, through rape and plunder. 

* He has specific gear that he wishes to find. The Plate Armour of the Deep numbers among them.

* He wishes to find ancient parchments written in the Old Tongue to discover antediluvian knowledge. 

========================================
EMOTES
========================================
He chews on sea weed.
A eerie tapping noise is heard: tap tap pause tap tap pause tap tap … 
He stretches his neck and waves his long grey hair about, splashing water on things nearby.
He hums a dire tune.
He nods sagely.
He ponders for a moment, and then grimaces suddenly.
His spreads his maw and starts licking his yellowish-green teeth.
He stretches and you hear the cracks of his spine. 
His face tightens and he starts bellowing a low groan that sounds like a dieing cat.
With his step his body lurches forward in what looks to be a painful march, his feet drag along the ground with strands of seaweed trailing behind.

========================================
ACTIONS
========================================

Vaghuul vocalises a guttural, inhuman sound: “stell’bsna fhalma”.  A rumbling vibration, almost like an earthquake, emanates from his shaking hand. Drawing upon the power of his Dark God, you feel tendrils of rippling blue energy weave through your flesh, sowing your wounds shut. 

A fluttering shadow on the wall accompanied by a creepy, echoed voice speaking: “n’ghft hupadgh gof’nn”. It utters in an incomprehensible language a number of words. A moment later mists seep out from the crevices of the room.

Vaghuul projects incomprehensibly in a strong voice: “ph'nglui mglw'nafh”. A green sap oozes from his hand and onto your wound, making your flesh feel chilly. It seals it like glue, and the pain subsides. 

“Vulgtm vugtlagln Vaghuul, y’hah” says Vaghuul. 

========================================
DIALOGUE
========================================

“History is a collection of doomed timelines.”
“The crawling chaos draws ever near.”
“In the beginning, the Kraken will be the size of many islands. After it slakes its thirst on my people, it will grow unimaginably large. In its final stages, it will grow a thousand eyes, a million of claws and jaws the size of worlds.”
“The dream eaters are tentacled horrors. They are pathetic replications of the Kraken.”
“Insanity is powerful when it provides momentum to an Axe.”
“There are things that Men was never meant to know.”
“The Swamps are the younger sisters to the Oceanic Depths.”
“My goals are clear. Revival of past glories. Domination of the Ocean. Return of the Monstrous Gods.”
“Reality is an asylum. Escape, a fate far worse than Death.”
“Contempt drives me to destroy the pride of the Land Men.”
“The Cities are dense masses of mental illness.”
“Your leaders treat you like mushrooms. They feed you shit, and keep you in the dark.”
“When the stars are ready, we wait, so that we will be in place to liberate him.”
“The Kraken awaits us, dreaming eternally.”
“I hail from the Nightmare Corpse-City.”
He grabs the prisoner by the throat, and pins him to the stony floor, “Your resistance is meaningless. Keeping you alive is the worst punishment I could give.”
“Inconceivable horrors await all who oppose the Kraken.”
“I keep you alive only so that you may drown in terror.”
“Honour is cancer.”
“The Kraken is the ultimate Evil. Gazing upon it will cause a screaming madness that will only end when you rip out your eyes.”
“It will feast on all Human lives, until nothing is left.”
“It would turn all the demi-humans into petrified but living mummies. If you were warded against this effect, you might still die.”
“Nobody deserves anything.”
“Fate is a delusion of whelping children.”
“There are other entities that will arise during the Pale Night.”
“The Pale Night is a time when night rapes day. Your eyes will perceive nothing but white noise.”
“As a Young boy, I sat homeless on the beach of bones. It was a barren graveyard. A place where men would die alone if they could not handle the future. I gazed for hours at the rising and falling tides, and I contemplated. I gained one important insight. The world operates without purpose or meaning. It is cyclical, unceasing, and without mercy, or any other kind of Human morality. Any notion we conjure up from our minds is simply our own delusions being imposed upon reality. In the end, it is futile, because we live and die in no way different to that of fish or seaweed.”
“Life is the goal of all living creatures. And it is goal that is always met with failure.”
“Reality will break you.”

Less Thematic Phrases

“Greetings, mortal.”
“Indeed, that is a wise choice.”
“Your lack of planning will be your folly.”
“Agreed. There is no better time than now for us to move forward.”
“Yes, mortal.”

Gear (10,500 gp)

<wields> (Glowing) (Humming) A +1 double sided Great Axe named ‘Conjoined Twins’. One blade is shimmering blue, the other a slimy green. 

History suggests that this blade was crafted from the melted remains of two axes that were once the signature weapon of the Two Kings of the Islands. Vying for power over the realm they fought in a bloody duel. Ironically, they dealt with each other a mortal wound, and now the ruler of the realm is a half-breed lower House who successfully cleaned up the rest of the shocked loyalists.

<on finger> Ring of Swimming. Made of pure coral, it has ominous scarring with bits of chipped teeth trapped in its engravings.

It is believed that the crafter who forged this ring was trapped on a foreboding island filled with carnivorous plants. He sought escape but the water current was too strong for his meek body. He spent almost three days crafting it. To his dismay, on the third day he was afflicted by a terrible poison from the local plant-life.
