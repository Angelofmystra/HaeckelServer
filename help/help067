* Mirror Imaging
* Target Fixation
* Inappropriate analogies
* Stovepiping
* Rational-actor hypothesis

The Other Culture
* To make a friend, one has to understand the culture of the potential friend, one's own culture, and how things which are rational in one may not translate to the other. 
* Proportionality bias
* Presumption of unitary action by organisations

The "other side"
* It seems inconceivable to planners that enemies would be so foolish to attack a power whose resources so exceeded their own, thus virtually guaranteeing defeat
* The "other side" makes different technological assumptions
* The "other side" does not make decisions as you do
* The "other side" may be trying to confuse you


Attack Patterns
* multiple, near-simultaneous attacks
* domination of a specific theatre in war

Survival strategies
* disguising one's target list
* maintaining the illusion of vast capability
