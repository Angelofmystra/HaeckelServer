'LEGENDARY SITES' 'MAGICAL LOCATIONS'

Legendary sites, similar to magical locations (a concept introduced in Dungeon Master’s Guide II), are areas with special properties or effects from which a character might gain a significant benefit.

Magical locations are areas that have been crafted by mighty magic or imbued with ancient power . They are hard to find and harder to use, and confer their powers but rarely . Legendary sites, in contrast, are places where great works have been wrought and where seemingly impossible deeds have occurred . These locations have a lesser kind of power. 

A site such as a sandy beach where an explorer stepped for the first time, or a plaza where a long-fallen marvel once towered, pulses with its own renown, if not with true magic. The stories that inspire these places and make them famous lend them reputations that can be shared by those who brush with such a site’s notoriety. 

Characters who visit these sites of historical import, incredible acts, mystery, and great danger come away changed, not just in the eyes of the public but in their own hearts as well.

Such legendary sites need not be unique . Their inspirational effects might develop wherever a spot becomes imbued with a momentous event or spectacular achievement.
