'VISION WARS'

Important! Remember door placement. Placing a door in the center of a wall would mean that a room provides a different vision landscape to a door placed in a corner, or one placed at an awkward angle designed to obscure vision, such as:

Low Light Vision

*	Elves with Torches see to a radius of 40ft for bright light, and 80ft for shadowy illumination
* 	Thus rooms can be planned to take advantage of an Elves normally excellent vision
*	*	An example would be cover, such as a thick pillar, placed such that it obscures specific areas of vision that from the door would most likely affect Elves
*	* 	Another example would be a Room with the dimensions of 85ft+


Human Vision

*	This kind of challenge rewards parties for having Low Light Vision
*	A Human with a Torch can see 20ft of bright light, and 40ft of shadowy illumination.
*	*	Therefore, a Room with 65ft to 80ft width, would mean that there is an area of blackness at the corners of view (which only Elves would see)

Interesting situations
*	Windy Tunnels
*	Perilous cliff faces
*	Jammed door - sudden change of air pressure creates a draft of wind
*	Flooded tunnels, underground lakes, waterfall from the above floor
*	Forcing everyone to be engaged in melee, causing the torch to drop and be wasted
* 	Areas with a smell of flammable gas
*	A 4-way intersection of massive corridors (read: like a highway), so being there with light would reveal their position to the entire dungeon
*	Make colour extremely important (especially to see dangers). So the party must rely on close range "bright vision" to see certain problems
*	Strange insects (moths) start circling the light source, fluttering about in a spiral path

Time Problematic Obstacles
-	Torches last for one hour, so certain obstacles can impose a torch tax
* 	Clearing rubble
*	Mazes
*	

Notes
*	Non-torch bearers who stick their head around a corner should not see jack shit
* 	Make sure descriptions in the concealment are indistinct
* 	Doors of poor quality, with a junky look, allow light to shine through. Even the slightest crack will signal monsters behind
