'HELPFILE WRITING GUIDELINES' 

The following article discusses help files. 

All changes to the help files are automatically catalogued and recorded using the Version Control System.

The first line of every help file must include the search terms to find it, written in single quotations. They should be written in full capital letters.

Any related articles should be described as such near the end: "For more guidance, see help on FIGHTERS or FIGHTER GAMEPLAY"
