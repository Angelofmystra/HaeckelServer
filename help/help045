'SHORTCOMINGS1'

What are the shortcomings of Skype, rolld20, and other such RP systems?

Every single aspect of the game either contributes, or penalises immersion & role-play in some meaningful way. Often times, it is a death by a thousand cuts. 

Here, lets look at some examples:

* Each time you are a forced to alt-tab in order to use multiple software
* Each time you are forced to see a large amount of dice text on the screen
* Each time you are unable to recall with exact precision what you see around you, or saw in the past
* Every time rules mechanics gets in the way of interactivity, and pacing

Each of these things slowly chip away at the quality of the game you are experiencing.

These are the kinds of things we aim to provide:

* The ability to control the output to your screen - such as if you wish to see how dice rolls were calculated. Some players may dislike this. 
* Maybe the GM does not like showing players damage figures, and instead wants some descriptors instead

But lets now look at it from the perspective of the GM. 

* The ability to store your descriptions (such as for areas, people, characters, items, spells) in a computerised form.
* Provide you enhanced capabilities to enhance verisimilitude in your campaigns.
