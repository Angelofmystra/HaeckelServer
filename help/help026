'GRAVEYARDS'

Graveyards in Haeckel RPG serve multiple purposes in terms of gameplay:

1) They are places for immoral grave robbers to loot, perhaps to regear
2) They are a source of corpses for Necromancers
3) They are a place of adventure, especially when there is access to deeper catacombs
4) Once the players have access to Raise Dead, etc, it is a place to find potentially long dead adventurers to bring back to life

Regarding point 4, this is part of the exploratory design. The players will see that only certain corpses are viable at each graveyard, and that there are a number of graveyards in Haeckel. 

Thus the players are rewarded for finding all the graveyards (especially those with restricted access, or are hidden and long forgotten) and finding out what is there.

So, observing tombstones serves a purpose!
