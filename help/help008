Potions

The standard potion is, of course, a vial filled with a magical libation, designed to be consumed by anyone and having the following characteristics.
• Single-use only—once consumed, the potion is gone.
• Limited to spells of 3rd level or lower.
• No special magical training required—anyone can drink a potion and gain the benefit of its magic.
• Must be physically manipulated in some way (unstoppered or broken, then consumed).
• Must be in the user’s hand to be used.
• Use provokes attacks of opportunity.

Within these broad guidelines, though, a number of alternate potion forms might be possible.

Scrolls

Unlike potions, scrolls require magical training (or the ability to mimic such training by means of the Use Magic Device skill) to use properly. The essential characteristics of a scroll are as follows.
• Single use only — once it is read, the writing that makes up a scroll is gone.
• Spell completion device—only a spellcaster can readily use a scroll, and he might need to make a level check to read a scroll of a spell level exceeding the maximum level of spell he can normally cast.
• Usable by means of the Use Magic Device skill.
• Must be physically manipulated in a complex way (held in the hand, unrolled, and read).
• Must be in the user’s hand to be used. 
• Use provokes attacks of opportunity.
