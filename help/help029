'DATABASE DESIGN'

Fourth normal form (4NF) is a normal form used in database normalization.

Whereas the second and third normal forms are concerned with functional dependencies, 4NF is concerned with a more general type of dependency known as a multivalued dependency.

First normal form deals with the "shape" of a record type.

Under first normal form, all occurrences of a record type must contain the same number of fields.

First normal form excludes variable repeating fields and groups. This is not so much a design guideline as a matter of definition. Relational database theory doesn't deal with records having a variable number of fields.
