'DIFFICULTY'

+ Deliciously difficult rather than crushingly punishing. 
+ Consistency of rules.
+ Give the players enough tools to work with - tools to approach problems in new ways.
+ Telegraphing - to make informed choices, even if split second.


Creating gameplay through intentional miscommunication doesnâ€™t actually add depth or personal mastery.

The job of clarity is to refine knowledge such that both parties can make intelligent choices.
